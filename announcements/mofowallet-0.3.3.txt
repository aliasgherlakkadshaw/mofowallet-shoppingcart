Mofowallet update

Supported coins and their embedded server versions:

 1. FIMK  0.3
 2. NXT   1.3.4

This is the first major update after initial mofowallet release. Improvements
where made on almost all levels.

API Request Manager

  The network request layer has been completely rewritten, it is now aware of all 
  active and pending (API) requests. Requests are grouped and can be prioritized or 
  canceled all together, requests are bound to the controllers that started them 
  and are automatically destroyed when the controller is destroyed.

  Network requests are executed from a central interval (timer) and is no longer
  event based. The interval acts as an external agent that can takes action and 
  cancel requests if they either time out or take too long to start (when higher 
  ranked requests take up all available slots).

  The number of concurrent requests are set at six for now, this seems to work well
  while running on localhost and when connected public API servers.

Decentralized API

  Improvements are made in the usage of the decentralized API, users can run their
  own API server and add these to mofowallet. Because of the usage of multiple 
  public API servers synchronization among those servers has to be performed 
  on startup. Synchronizing involves a check if the server is up and functioning 
  and a detailed analysis of the fork that server is on.

  Public API servers that are on a fork are ignored for the current session this 
  way not wasting any network traffic.

  API servers are required to have SSL enabled and must use a proper certificate.

Embedded Servers

  Users are prompted if they want to start the embedded FIMK and/or NXT server on 
  startup, options for each server are available to either start automatically 
  or never start at all.

  Users can run both servers at the same time but this does put a higher load on
  your system. Running the servers is however not required since mofowallet is
  fully functional when operating on the public API servers only.

Forging

  Forging/mining is supported for all embedded servers. The blockchain must be
  downloaded before you can forge blocks. The forging UI has been updated and
  now requires your secret phrase to be entered only once, either enter your 
  secret phrase or open your wallet file containing your secret phrase.
  To see if you forged any blocks for now you will need to look at the amount 
  forged label in the accounts section. Better feedback of exactly what blocks
  you forged and other info like charts and averaged are under development.

Namespaced Aliases

  Namespaced aliases now support encryption. This is the same encryption AES 
  encryption offered for normal messages. Namespaced Aliases can be encrypted
  so only the owner account can decrypt or where the owner account and one 
  other account can decrypt that.

Asset Exchange

  Introducing the initial Asset Exchange UI for FIMK and NXT. UI is read only
  in this release meaning you cannot enter or cancel orders. Asset Exchange 
  is a work in progress and is suspected to change considerably.
  Our aim is to offer a professional full featured interface to both
  the FIMK and NXT decentralized exchanges. We consider a professional UI one
  that offers traders all tools required to do your daily trading.

  Current AE UI includes:

  1. historical price charts
  2. listing of all available assets
  3. display of current price and 24 hour percent change

  Planned AE UI additions:

  4. in client per asset blockchain based commenting
  5. better charting (moving average, candle stick etc..)
  6. automatic actions based on blockchain events (this requires the client 
     to stay on)

Better Messaging

  Better support for sending plain text or encrypted messages. Message 
  transactions in the transaction history are displayed inline now. If you
  provided your secret phrase messages are decrypted on the fly and can be
  seen inline in the account transaction history but also in the blockexplorer.

Startup Service

  New service available to all plugins, plugins register with the startup 
  service to do intialization upon application startup. Plugins register
  so called activities that show progress in the startup dialog, activities
  can be made to run only after certain other activities have finished 
  running.

  The startup dialog can be hidden by the user and the mofowallet is usable
  from that moment on. If certain functionality in mofowallet depends on 
  an activity to complete it will be disabled until the activity has completed.

Highly Contextual Identifiers

  All identifiers for blocks, transactions, accounts, aliases, block heights and
  more now support mouse events. Plugins can register for mouseover, mouseout and
  click events. This has enabled everything from the blockexplorer to the account
  section to be *clickable* and will show you a details dialog in which everything
  is again clickable.

Bugs fixed

  Fixed a bug where sometimes sending a transaction does not immediately show
  up in your list of recent transactions. This works correct for all broadcasted 
  transactions now.

  Fixed numerous performance bottle necks, desktop mofowallet is much faster
  than the initial 0.3 release.

  Fixed the problem of mofowallet constantly sending requests to obtain state
  from the public servers. The rewritten network layer fixed this.

  Fixed a bug where sending a transaction gave no meaningful feedback, on 
  sending transactions the user now sees a dialog that shows transaction 
  creation, signing and broadcasted feedback.
