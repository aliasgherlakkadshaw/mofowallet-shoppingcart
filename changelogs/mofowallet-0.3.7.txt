MofoWallet

  Changed the way mofowallet handles the sending and verification of transactions,
  all transactions are now controlled from a dialog that displays the status, 
  success, failure and progress of the various stages in sending transactions:

  1. Creating transactions
  2. Signing transactions
  3. Broadcasting transactions
  4. Detecting transactions are in unconfirmed pool
  5. Detecting transactions are in a block
