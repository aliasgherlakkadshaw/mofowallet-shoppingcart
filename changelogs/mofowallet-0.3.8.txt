Mofowallet update

Supported coins and their embedded server versions:

 1. FIMK  0.3.3
 2. NXT   1.3.5

Upgraded embedded NXT and FIMK servers. 

If you are using MofoWallet as a *full node* (if you start the embedded 
FIMK server) then update is mandatory since the previous embedded 
FIMK 0.3.2 and earlier versions are no longer supported.
