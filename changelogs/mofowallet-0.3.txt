FIMK specific features:

 1. Namespaced alias support 

    FIMK Namespaced Aliases are scoped per account. 
    This means you can use any alias you wish, even the same ones that someone else is using.
    Namespaced Alias makes the blockchain more suitable for storing small pieces of data in 
    decentralized storage.
    The aliases you register are stored either in plain text or encrypted and can thus be read 
    by anyone or only be read through access to your account, or access details that you grant 
    to a third party (setting a Namespaced Alias costs 0.1 FIM)
